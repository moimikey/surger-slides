    <!--

    This open-source project was written in ES6 and transpiled into ES5 for general
    use. By determining the users geo coordinates we can use the Uber API to get
    immediate information such as surge pricing within the users proximity.

    <!-- NOTES -->
    <!--

    What is passed to the API are coordinates that are received by triangulating the
    users location, thanks to another open source project called wifi-location. What
    we get back is information about the location, including a `surge_multiplier`
    value. Any value other than `1` would denote that surge pricing is active, and
    that is the multiplier.
